// The Mist Disconnect Console, v1.4, as one tool in the menu.
//
// Deliberately not rebuilt inside the toolbox shell. The console is a finished,
// parity-tested tool (182 assertions in tests/parity.test.js) whose controller
// binds to its own element IDs at module load, and whose UI wants a whole tab:
// a sticky header, full-screen radio-event overlays, Esc handling and wide
// tables. Opening console.html in its own tab keeps that code untouched and
// keeps its own 30-minute idle wipe governing its own token.
//
// The one visible cost is that the console asks for the token itself rather
// than inheriting the shell's — which is also why its token never has to cross
// a page boundary to get there.
