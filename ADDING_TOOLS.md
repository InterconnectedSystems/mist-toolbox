# Adding your own tools

Mist Toolbox is **additive**. The tools it ships with are a starting point, and anyone can add
more without touching the extension's code. A tool is **one JavaScript file**. The toolbox
supplies everything else:

- the menu card;
- the token, region and org selection;
- the site picker with "All sites in the org";
- the settings form, Run/Cancel, progress bar and activity log;
- the on-screen preview and the styled `.xlsx` download.

You don't need to write that file yourself. The extension **ships its own LLM spec**,
[`TOOL_PROMPT.md`](mist-toolbox/docs/TOOL_PROMPT.md). It is a ready-made prompt that teaches any
AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini…) the tool format, the helpers available, the
security rules, and a complete working example. Paste the prompt, paste the script or describe
the report you want, and the assistant returns a file you can install.

```
 your script or idea ─┐
                      ├─► AI assistant ─► my-report.js ─► Manage tools → Install ─► new tool card
 TOOL_PROMPT.md ──────┘    (any LLM)
```

## Step by step

### 1. Copy the AI prompt

Open the toolbox, press **Manage tools** (under the tool cards), then **Copy AI prompt**.

![Manage tools → Copy AI prompt](mist-toolbox/docs/screenshots/17-manage-copy-prompt.png)

You can also read it, copy it or download it from the docs viewer (**Authoring guide** → *AI
prompt*), or take it straight from GitHub: [`mist-toolbox/docs/TOOL_PROMPT.md`](mist-toolbox/docs/TOOL_PROMPT.md).

### 2. Paste it into an AI assistant, then add your script

Start a new chat and paste the prompt. It ends with a marker line; put your script, or a plain
description of the report you want, underneath it:

![The end of the prompt: paste your script below the line](mist-toolbox/docs/screenshots/16-ai-prompt-paste-slot.png)

Things you can paste below the line:

- an existing **Python, Node.js or PowerShell** script that calls the Mist API;
- a **description**, e.g. *"For each site, list every AP with its name, model, firmware and
  uptime, and flag APs that have been offline more than a day."*;
- a **Mist API doc snippet** for the endpoint you want to report on.

The assistant replies with a single JavaScript file. Save it with a short name ending in `.js`,
such as `ap-firmware.js`.

> The prompt tells the assistant to keep your script's API calls, columns and sorting, to use
> the toolbox's site picker for anything that covers sites, and to follow the security rules
> below. If the toolbox rejects the file, paste the error message back to the assistant and ask
> it to fix the file.

### 3. Install it

In **Manage tools**, drop the `.js` file on the box (or click to choose it). The file is checked
before anything is written. A file that breaks a rule is turned away with the reason; this is
what happens with a Node script that was not converted:

![A Node script is explained, not installed](mist-toolbox/docs/screenshots/14-manage-tools.png)

A file that passes shows the tool's name and the filename it will install as:

![The AI's file passes the check](mist-toolbox/docs/screenshots/18-manage-check-passed.png)

Press **Install**. The first time in a tab, the browser asks you to pick a folder: choose the
**`mist-toolbox`** folder you loaded with *Load unpacked*, and allow the browser to edit it. The
file is written into `mist-toolbox/tools/` and listed in `tools/tools.json`. The new card
appears straight away, without reloading the extension, so your token stays signed in.

### 4. Use it

The new tool sits in the menu with the others, marked **added**, with its own **Remove** button:

![The added tool's card](mist-toolbox/docs/screenshots/20-home-added-tool.png)

It runs like a built-in tool, with the same site picker, progress, preview and `.xlsx` download:

### Removing a tool

Press **Remove** under its card, or in **Manage tools → Added tools**. The file is deleted from
`tools/` and taken out of `tools/tools.json`. Built-in tools cannot be removed.

## The rules every tool follows

The checker enforces these before installing, and the AI prompt teaches them:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| No `require`, `process`, `fs` or npm packages | Tools run in the browser, not in Node |
| No direct `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest` / `WebSocket` | All Mist calls go through `ctx.getAll` / `ctx.mistGet`, which only talk to the Mist region you picked |
| Read-only: no POST/PUT/DELETE | The toolbox never changes your network |
| No browser storage or cookies | Nothing, especially the token, is ever saved |
| No `console.*`, `eval` or dynamic `import()` | Progress goes to the activity log; the extension's security policy forbids the rest |

The check catches mistakes, not deliberate tricks. A tool runs with access to your Mist session,
so only install tools you wrote or got from people you trust.

## Writing tools by hand

The full reference is the [authoring guide](mist-toolbox/docs/TOOL_GUIDE.md): every `ctx`
helper, the form field types, the `scope: "site"` option and the result format. A working
starting point is [`tool-template.js`](mist-toolbox/docs/tool-template.js). Without the
**Manage tools** button: copy the file into `mist-toolbox/tools/`, run `npm run scan` (or add
its filename to `tools/tools.json`), and reload the extension.
